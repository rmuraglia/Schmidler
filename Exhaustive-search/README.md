For all cases, samples drawn by independent equilibrium sampling at each state. Both normal and bimodal target distributions examined.

Thesis (and chronological, progression of ideas) order is:

1. _totvar_: Total variation distance as distance metric. 
2. _varbar_: Estimated asymptotic variance of BAR free energy estimate (equivalent to estimated asymptotic relative variance of BAR ratio estimate) between adjacent states as distance metric.  
3. _fixed-length_: Same varBAR distance metric as in (2). Path search constrained to fixed path length (number of edges) to correct for total sampling burden per path. Alternate dynamic programming search algorithm used in the place of Dijkstra's algorithm.
