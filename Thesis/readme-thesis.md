TeX files and source for my thesis.

dukedissertation.cls defines the custom document class for Duke theses. I made a handful of edits to fix some oversights related to MS theses and my degree being conferred by an interdisciplinary program, as opposed to a single department.

RM_thesis.tex calls tex files in other directories which contain the meat of the content. 
Figures directory contains image files used in the thesis.
Talk and Talk-imgs directories contain tex files to make my beamer presentation for the oral defense, and figures used in that slide deck.
